# 🚀 Bikram Parui — Personal Portfolio

> *"First I learned HTML. Then CSS. Then JavaScript. Now I make the browser do things it didn't know it wanted to do."*

## 👀 Wait, don't scroll past this

Look, I know what you're thinking. *"It's just another portfolio."*

You're wrong.

This one has:
- ✨ A **particle starfield** because space is cool and flat backgrounds are not
- 🖱️ A **custom cursor** because the default one is so 2003
- ⌨️ A **typing animation** because watching text appear is weirdly satisfying
- 🎞️ **Scroll-triggered animations** because things shouldn't just *be there* — they should *arrive*
- 🥚 **3 hidden easter eggs** because good software always rewards the curious

## 🛠️ Built With

| Thing | Why |
|---|---|
| HTML | The skeleton. Every website has one. |
| CSS | The drip. Most websites could use more of it. |
| JavaScript | The magic. Turns "static page" into "oh wait, that's alive" |
| Google Fonts | Because Arial is a war crime |
| One `<canvas>` element | Doing the work of an entire design team |

No frameworks. No `npm install`. No `node_modules` folder that weighs more than the universe. Just three files and a dream.

## 🥚 Easter Eggs (Spoilers Below — You've Been Warned)

There are 3 hidden secrets baked in. Try to find them yourself first. If you give up:

<details>
<summary>🔍 Hint #1 — For gamers</summary>

Some classic cheat codes never die. Try the <strong>Konami Code</strong> on the keyboard: ↑ ↑ ↓ ↓ ← → ← → B A

</details>

<details>
<summary>🔍 Hint #2 — For the clicky type</summary>

The logo in the top-left corner is more interactive than it looks. Give it some love. Like, five times worth of love.

</details>

<details>
<summary>🔍 Hint #3 — For fellow developers</summary>

Open your browser's DevTools console (`F12` or right-click → Inspect → Console). There's a personal message waiting.

## 💡 For Fellow Beginners (Hey, That Might Be You!)

If you're just getting into web dev and looking at this code thinking *"how does any of this work"* — that's completely normal and also kind of the best feeling in the world.

Here's the secret: every senior developer has, at some point, Googled "how to center a div." Every single one.

A few things worth learning from this project:

- **CSS Custom Properties** (`--cyan`, `--pink`) — write a colour once, use it everywhere. Change it in one place. Feel like a wizard.
- **IntersectionObserver** — the elegant way to trigger animations on scroll, without a single `scroll` event listener destroying your performance.
- **`clip-path`** — turns boring rectangles into slick parallelograms. One line of CSS. Disproportionate visual payoff.
- **Canvas API** — scary-sounding, but the starfield is genuinely just 40 lines of "draw a dot, move it slightly, repeat."
- **The Konami Code** — a `keydown` event listener and a little array. That's it. Easter eggs are not magic; they're just code that most people don't bother to write.

## 📁 Project Structure

```
html-portfolio-by-bikram/
│
├── index.html       ← Everything. The whole thing. One file.
├── myphoto.jpg      ← The man himself
└── README.md        ← You are here 👈
```

Yes, it's all in one file. Is that architecturally ideal for a large-scale enterprise application? No. Is it *perfect* for a personal portfolio that just needs to slap? Absolutely yes.

## 🤝 Want to Use This?

Go for it. Fork it, clone it, dissect it, learn from it. That's literally what it's here for.

If you end up making your own version, the only request is that you make it *yours* — your colours, your fonts, your easter eggs. The web is way more interesting when everyone's portfolio doesn't look like they all used the same Figma template.
